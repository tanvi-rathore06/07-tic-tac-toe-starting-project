📄 Project Overview
This project is a starter template for building a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using modern JavaScript, HTML & CSS — ideal if you want to build the game logic, UI, or extend it further (AI opponent, multiplayer, styling, etc.). 
It leverages a clean project setup with build tooling and a basic structure so you can focus on implementing game logic and UI.

**What’s Included / Tech Stack**
JavaScript (ES6+) — core logic and UI scripting
HTML / CSS — minimal styling and markup
Build & Bundler Setup — configured to support modern development (see vite.config.js)
Project scaffold — a simple, clean starting structure, ready for further development

**Project Structure**
07-tic-tac-toe-starting-project/
│  
├─ public/               # Static files (if any)  
├─ src/                  # Source files (game logic, components, styles)  
├─ index.html            # Entry HTML file  
├─ package.json          # Project metadata & dependencies  
├─ vite.config.js        # Build/bundler configuration  
├─ .gitignore            # Files to ignore in Git  
└─ .gitattributes        # Git attributes file  
Note: src/ is where you’ll build out the React components, game logic, styling, etc.

**Getting Started**
To set up the project locally:
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tanvi-rathore06/07-tic-tac-toe-starting-project.git
# 2. Change directory
cd 07-tic-tac-toe-starting-project
# 3. Install dependencies
npm install
# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
# 5. Open in your browser
# Default: http://localhost:5173  (or as configured by Vite)

You can then begin building your Tic-Tac-Toe UI and logic inside the src/ directory.
